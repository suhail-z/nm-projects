## Overview
This project implements an advanced Speech Recognition (ASR) system that is specifically designed to handle different English accents. The system uses deep learning techniques and speaker adaptation to improve recognition accuracy across various English accents. It's particularly useful for applications requiring robust speech recognition across diverse English-speaking populations.

## Features
- Accent-aware speech recognition
- Deep learning-based ASR model
- Support for multiple English accents
- MFCC feature extraction
- Model training and evaluation pipeline
- Word Error Rate (WER) calculation
- Real-time inference capabilities
- Model checkpointing and saving
- Performance visualization tools

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchaudio
- librosa
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- jiwer (for WER calculation)
- matplotlib
